#### About this project: 
This project was made as a school project to try out building a MVC in asp.net Core. The task was to follow this guide: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-mvc-app/. When we had completed the tutorial we had to make some minor adjustments to the code, like creating a new endpoint that would return "Hello Alexander" if /Extra/Hey?name=Alexander was called, or adding a new field (for example "Director") to the app.

#### Technologies used: 
* **C#/ ASP.NET Core** for backend. 
* **CSS** for design.
* **HTML** for layout.
* **JS/ Jquery** for effects and functionality.
